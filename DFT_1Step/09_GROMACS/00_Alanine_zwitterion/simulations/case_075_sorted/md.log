Linking all bonded interactions to atoms


NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cpus
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin threads to cpus.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).
